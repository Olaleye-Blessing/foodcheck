# FOOD RECIPE

All you need to prepare your favourite dish

Created with react.js, styled-components

## Why I built This Project

The main purpose of this project is to learn about unit and component testing.

## How to navigate

-   The [pages folder](https://github.com/Olaleye-Blessing/foodcheck/tree/master/src/pages/) contains the 2 pages used in this project
-   [Modules](https://github.com/Olaleye-Blessing/foodcheck/tree/master/src/Modules) contains different components used on each page
-   Each tested component/unit can be found just directly under their main folder. e.g [Recipe page](https://github.com/Olaleye-Blessing/foodcheck/tree/master/src/pages/Recipes)

## If I had more time

-   I would add more testing
-   Improve the general UI
